======================
Text annotations in 3D
======================

Demonstrates the placement of text annotations on a 3D plot.

Functionality shown:
- Using the text function with three types of 'zdir' values: None,
  an axis name (ex. 'x'), or a direction tuple (ex. (1, 1, 0)).
- Using the text function with the color keyword.
- Using the text2D function to place text on a fixed position on the ax object.

# Demo 1: zdir
zdirs = (None, 'x', 'y', 'z', (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1))
xs = (1, 4, 4, 9, 4, 1)
ys = (2, 5, 8, 10, 1, 2)
zs = (10, 3, 8, 9, 1, 8)

    label = '(%d, %d, %d), dir=%s' % (x, y, z, zdir)
    ax.text(x, y, z, label, zdir)

# Demo 2: color
ax.text(9, 0, 0, "red", color='red')

# Demo 3: text2D
# Placement 0, 0 would be the bottom left, 1, 1 would be the top right.
