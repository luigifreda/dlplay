"""
Now we go for a much better application. In this, we draw either rectangles or circles (depending on the mode we select) by dragging the mouse like we do in Paint application. So our mouse callback function has two parts, one to draw rectangle and other to draw the circles. 
This specific example will be really helpful in creating and understanding some interactive applications like object tracking, image segmentation etc.
