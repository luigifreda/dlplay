Rotation
Rotation of an image for an angle \theta is achieved by the transformation matrix of the form

M = \begin{bmatrix} cos\theta & -sin\theta \\ sin\theta & cos\theta   \end{bmatrix}

But OpenCV provides scaled rotation with adjustable center of rotation so that you can rotate at any location you prefer. Modified transformation matrix is given by

\begin{bmatrix} \alpha &  \beta & (1- \alpha )  \cdot center.x -  \beta \cdot center.y \\ - \beta &  \alpha &  \beta \cdot center.x + (1- \alpha )  \cdot center.y \end{bmatrix}

M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((cols/2,rows/2),90,1)
dst = cv2.warpAffine(img,M,(cols,rows))

cv2.imshow('img',img)
